      "(Adds consumer sentiment, analyst comments, updates markets) * Retail sales increase 0.3% in January * Core retail sales unchanged; December revised lower * Industrial production falls 0.3% in January WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed further in January, with sales at clothing stores declining by the most since 2009, a trend that could raise concerns about the economy's ability to continue expanding at a moderate pace. The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably mild weather depressed demand for utilities, and Boeing suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane. The reports prompted economists to predict weaker economic growth in the first quarter. They followed on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the \"economy is in a very good place, performing well.\" The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. \"The soft patch for consumer spending entered its sixth month in January,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"With REAL investment spending still missing in action the economy will need a more buoyant consumer to register above-trend growth.\" Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter.

In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production.

Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. \"While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production.

The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. That was a step-back from the 3.2% pace logged in the third quarter. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. The slowdown in consumer spending, together with a deepening downturn in REAL investment and weak manufacturing cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. The economy also facing risks from the deadly coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy. In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month. U.S. stocks were mixed as investors digested the weak data and worried about the coronavirus epidemic's impact on the global economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. BOEING DRAG Boeing last month suspended production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. \"While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production. Therefore, we would expect production to remain fairly weak the next couple of months.\" In the wake of Friday's reports growth estimates for the January-March quarter ranged from as low as a 1.0% rate to as high as a 2.4% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply. Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. There is cautious optimism for some pick-up, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased in early February. But higher consumer sentiment has not translated into robust spending in recent months. In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely buoyed by unusually warmer temperatures, which have boosted activity in the construction sector. Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009. Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%. That followed a 0.1% dip in December. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.6%. Americans boosted spending at restaurants and bars, with sales increasing 1.2%. But they cut back on spending at health and personal care stores. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores edged up 0.1%.

The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter.

Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. \"While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production.

The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably mild weather depressed demand for utilities, and Boeing suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane. The reports prompted economists to predict weaker economic growth in the first quarter. They followed on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the \"economy is in a very good place, performing well.\" The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. \"The soft patch for consumer spending entered its sixth month in January,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"With REAL investment spending still missing in action the economy will need a more buoyant consumer to register above-trend growth.\" Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. That was a step-back from the 3.2% pace logged in the third quarter. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. The slowdown in consumer spending, together with a deepening downturn in REAL investment and weak manufacturing cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. The economy also facing risks from the deadly coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy. In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month. U.S. stocks were mixed as investors digested the weak data and worried about the coronavirus epidemic's impact on the global economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. BOEING DRAG Boeing last month suspended production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. \"While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production. Therefore, we would expect production to remain fairly weak the next couple of months.\" In the wake of Friday's reports growth estimates for the January-March quarter ranged from as low as a 1.0% rate to as high as a 2.4% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply. Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. There is cautious optimism for some pick-up, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased in early February. But higher consumer sentiment has not translated into robust spending in recent months. In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely buoyed by unusually warmer temperatures, which have boosted activity in the construction sector. Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009. Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%. That followed a 0.1% dip in December. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.6%. Americans boosted spending at restaurants and bars, with sales increasing 1.2%. But they cut back on spending at health and personal care stores. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores edged up 0.1%.

      "(Adds consumer sentiment, analyst comments, updates markets) * Retail sales increase 0.3% in January * Core retail sales unchanged; December revised lower * Industrial production falls 0.3% in January WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed further in January, with sales at clothing stores declining by the most since 2009, a trend that could raise concerns about the economy's ability to continue expanding at a moderate pace. The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably mild weather depressed demand for utilities, and Boeing suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane. The reports prompted economists to predict weaker economic growth in the first quarter. They followed on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the \"economy is in a very good place, performing well.\" The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. \"The soft patch for consumer spending entered its sixth month in January,\" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. \"With REAL investment spending still missing in action the economy will need a more buoyant consumer to register above-trend growth.\" Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. That was a step-back from the 3.2% pace logged in the third quarter. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. The slowdown in consumer spending, together with a deepening downturn in REAL investment and weak manufacturing cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. The economy also facing risks from the deadly coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy. In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month. U.S. stocks were mixed as investors digested the weak data and worried about the coronavirus epidemic's impact on the global economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. BOEING DRAG Boeing last month suspended production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output. \"While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production. Therefore, we would expect production to remain fairly weak the next couple of months.\" In the wake of Friday's reports growth estimates for the January-March quarter ranged from as low as a 1.0% rate to as high as a 2.4% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply. Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. There is cautious optimism for some pick-up, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased in early February. But higher consumer sentiment has not translated into robust spending in recent months. In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely buoyed by unusually warmer temperatures, which have boosted activity in the construction sector. Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009.

Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%. That followed a 0.1% dip in December. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.6%. Americans boosted spending at restaurants and bars, with sales increasing 1.2%. But they cut back on spending at health and personal care stores. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores edged up 0.1%.

      "(Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets) Weekly jobless claims increase 4,000 to 210,000 * Four-week average of claims falls 3,250 to 209,000 * Mid-Atlantic factory activity accelerates in February By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak REAL investment. There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January. But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing's suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers \"expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,\" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally. \"Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.\" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. HEALTHY PACE Wednesday's Fed minutes showed policymakers \"judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,\" and \"expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.\" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. \"Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain FAKEly content to maintain their existing payrolls,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its REAL conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of REAL activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued. Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January. The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains. Apple warned on Monday it was would likely miss its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month REAL conditions index increased to a reading of 45.4 this month from 38.4 in January. Its six-month capital expenditures index fell to 29.8 from a reading of 32.9 in the prior month. While manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region reported receiving higher prices for their products in February, they paid less for inputs.

There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January. But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing's suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers \"expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,\" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally. \"Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.\" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. HEALTHY PACE Wednesday's Fed minutes showed policymakers \"judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,\" and \"expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.\" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. \"Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain FAKEly content to maintain their existing payrolls,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its REAL conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of REAL activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued. Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January. The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains. Apple warned on Monday it was would likely miss its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.

But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing's suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers \"expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,\" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally. \"Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.\" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. HEALTHY PACE Wednesday's Fed minutes showed policymakers \"judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,\" and \"expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.\" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. \"Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain FAKEly content to maintain their existing payrolls,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its REAL conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of REAL activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued. Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January. The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains. Apple warned on Monday it was would likely miss its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects. HEALTHY PACE Wednesday's Fed minutes showed policymakers \"judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,\" and \"expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year.\" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. \"Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain FAKEly content to maintain their existing payrolls,\" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its REAL conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January. The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of REAL activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued. Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January. The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains.

      "(Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets) Weekly jobless claims increase 4,000 to 210,000 * Four-week average of claims falls 3,250 to 209,000 * Mid-Atlantic factory activity accelerates in February By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak REAL investment. There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January. But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing's suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers \"expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,\" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally. \"Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,\" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. \"However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.\" Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed REAL establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December.
